### Synopsis: 
 The player must go through a generic workday and resist the temptations to breach Cybersecurity protocol. If the player makes the wrong decision, the game will provide a detailed explanation why it was the wrong decision.
 
 All content (scripts, assets, textures) was created by me, excluding "Walking on Sunshine" by Katrina and the Waves and the cow and receptionist models from the game _Barnyard_.
